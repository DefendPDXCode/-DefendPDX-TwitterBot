# -DefendPDX-TwitterBot
This is the open-source bot that runs the Twitter Bot on @DefendPDX

# Planned Scope
The idea is to create a new twitter retweeting bot that will Retweet users using the "#DefendPDX" hashtag as a callsign to the bot. With a little bit of added security, we want to make sure the bot has the option to enable/disable a whitelist. 

1. Strict Whitelist: Enabled during an event/action and only trusted/reputable people & organizations can boost through the bot.
2. Extended Whitelist: A list of accounts that are added by moderators, just a simple manual profile review and they're added in.
3. Unmoderatred: Anyone/Everyone can use the bot to RT, but not those already blocked/muted.
